Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
====================

A script 'run_analysis.R' is written to collect, work with and clean the data sets.

The original data is downloaded from: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Data are read from the following files to merge into one data set:

 	features.txt
 	activity_labels.txt
 	train/X_train.txt
 	train/y_train.txt
 	subject_train.txt
 	train/X_test.txt
 	train/y_test.txt
 	subject_test.txt

The code book indicates all the variables selected and summaries calculated.
